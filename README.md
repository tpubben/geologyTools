curve_duplicates.py

This utility takes either an LAS or TXT curve file and a column number, runs through the specified column and removes any duplicate rows so that they can be imported properly into Wellsight Systems' Striplog software without error.
This utitity works perfectly with the LAS file spec and the output overwrites the input file.
